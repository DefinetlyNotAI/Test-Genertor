Reads the Test.csv file and generates a dictionary of its headers.
    Questions: {questions}
    Question Type: {question_type}
    Difficulty: {difficulty}
    Score: {score}
Validates the csv file by the following ruleset:
    No value is empty,
    Difficulty is either Hard, Medium, or Easy EXACTLY
    Score is a number between 0-100

Reads the .config file and saves its values in variables:
    questions_amount (first line in the file, values are variable=Number)
    minimum_titles
    hard_percentage
    medium_percentage
    easy_percentage
    points
Validate by the following rules
    No value is empty
    All values are numbers
    the percentages all add up to 100
    question_amount is smaller than the csv files question amount

Create then an exam consisting of the following rules
    No questions should be repeated more than once,
    The list length should be equal to {questions_amount} EXACTLY from the config file
    The list must include AT LEAST {minimum_titles} amount of titles
    The list must have EXACTLY {points} amount of points
    The list must have the ratio of difficulty presented from the following variables: {hard_percentage},{medium_percentage}{easy_percentage}

If a error occurs in the csv or config, please make the error say which line it is and why,

Also when the exam is generated make it also print stats like total points of the exam, questions answered and difficulty ratio etc
